The article addresses the scientiﬁc and the biological history of the Lombard effect: ﬁrst, it sketches the evolution of the study of the Lombard effect, and second it reﬂects on the biological evolution of the effect itself. By comparing the ﬁndings from anurans, birds and mammals, we try to trace back the phylogenetic origins of this basic vocal mechanism for acoustic communication in noise. The current evidence suggests two alternative parsimonious hypotheses: either the Lombard effect is the outcome of a convergent evolution in birds and mammals or it may be a synapomorphy of all amniotes. If the latter is true, then the Lombard effect would have evolved to maintain vocal communication in the presence of noise more than 300 million years ago.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the production and perception of speech in diverse conditions for the purposes of accurate, ﬂexible and highly intelligible talking face animation. We recorded audio, video and facial motion capture data of a talker uttering a set of 180 short sentences, under three conditions: normal speech (in quiet), Lombard speech (in noise), and whispering. We then produced an animated 3D avatar with similar shape and appearance as the original talker and used an error minimization procedure to drive the animated version of the talker in a way that matched the original performance as closely as possible. In a perceptual intelligibility study with degraded audio we then compared the animated talker against the real talker and the audio alone, in terms of audio-visual word recognition rate across the three different production conditions. We found that the visual intelligibility of the animated talker was on par with the real talker for the Lombard and whisper conditions. In addition we created two incongruent conditions where normal speech audio was paired with animated Lombard speech or whispering. When compared to the congruent normal speech condition, Lombard animation yields a signiﬁcant increase in intelligibility, despite the AV-incongruence. In a separate evaluation, we gathered subjective opinions on the different animations, and found that some degree of incongruence was generally accepted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Growing old is part of the human life cycle, but societies differ considerably in how old age is defined and how the elderly are perceived and treated. Are they respected, valued, and cared for, or are they denigrated and treated poorly? What may account for these differences? In trying to answer these questions, it is important to consider the widest possible set of societies, ranging from smaller-scale nonindustrial societies to larger industrial and post-industrial societies.},
